## Overview

An IT Helpdesk serves as a critical support system within an organization, providing a centralized platform for managing technical issues and enhancing communication between IT staff and employees. The primary function of an IT Helpdesk is to streamline the process of reporting and resolving IT-related problems, ensuring that employees can focus on their core responsibilities without unnecessary interruptions.

## Key Features

- **Employee Device Management**: This feature allows administrators to oversee and manage all employee devices within the organization. It includes functionalities such as adding new devices, tracking their status, assigning devices to employees, and updating records as necessary. This centralized management helps streamline operations and ensures that employees have access to the necessary tools for their work.
- **Ticket Submission for Faulty Devices**: This functionality enables employees to report issues with their devices by submitting tickets through the helpdesk platform. The system captures essential information about the device and the nature of the fault, allowing IT support staff to prioritize and address the issues efficiently. This process enhances responsiveness and ensures that devices are quickly repaired or replaced, minimizing downtime.
- **Message Management**: The message management feature allows for efficient communication between employees and IT support staff. Users can send and receive messages related to their tickets or general inquiries, creating a clear line of communication that aids in resolving issues quickly. This feature may include notifications for new messages, ensuring that both parties stay informed throughout the troubleshooting process.
- **Notifications**: The notification system keeps users updated on the status of their tickets, new messages, and any important announcements from the IT department. Notifications can be triggered by various actions, such as ticket updates or replies in the chat, ensuring that employees are informed in a timely manner. This feature helps to maintain engagement and ensures that users do not miss critical information regarding their support requests.
- **Profile Management**: This feature allows users to manage their personal profiles on the helpdesk platform. Employees can update their contact information, view their ticket history, and track the status of their submitted tickets. Profile management contributes to a personalized user experience and helps users maintain control over their interactions with the IT support team.

## Technologies Used

- **Codeigniter**: Used as the back-end framework to build a scalable and secure server-side application, enabling efficient extraction and handling of data. It provides a structured MVC architecture that simplifies development and supports faster integration of functionalities.
- **Bootstrap**: Employed for building the front-end codebase, Bootstrap ensures the creation of clean, reusable components that deliver a responsive and consistent user interface.
- **MySQL (PhpMyAdmin)**: Utilized for managing relational data efficiently, PhpMyAdmin allows for dynamic management of database structures, specifically handling relational data such as employee devices, their assigned responsible employees, and the roles of the technicians. This ensures that key relationships between devices, employee, and technical support roles are maintained, providing a clear and organized system for IT support operations.
