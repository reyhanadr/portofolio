## Overview

In my role as a Fullstack Web Developer at Valuble Media, I was tasked with creating, maintaining, and upgrading a cryptocurrency news and education website. The project progressed through two main phases: the initial development phase utilized the Nicepage Plugin, followed by a comprehensive redevelopment using WordPress that included extensive theme customization. I integrated OpenAI to introduce AI-powered chatbots for handling crypto-related inquiries and assisting content creators in generating articles. To enhance the website's functionality, I implemented the CoinGecko API for cryptocurrency-to-fiat conversions and optimized its SEO performance by leveraging OpenAI’s recommendations for article structure improvements. Throughout the development process, I ensured the website's smooth operation, managed ongoing upgrades, and resolved any issues that arose.
