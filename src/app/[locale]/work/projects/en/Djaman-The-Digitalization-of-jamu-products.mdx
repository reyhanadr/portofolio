## Overview

This project is the digitalization of jamu products from Paguyuban Jamu Manunggal in Cimahi, part of the PKM-PI (Program Kreatif Mahasiswa-Penerapan IPTEK) initiative under Merdeka Belajar from KEMENDIKBUDRISTEK. In this project, I developed a website for the sale of traditional herbal medicine (jamu) with several key features.

## Key Features

- **Product Management Tools**: This feature enables administrators to efficiently manage jamu products on the website. It includes functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting products, as well as managing related information such as descriptions, pricing, and product type. With robust product management tools, users can quickly update product information, ensuring that the data displayed to customers is always accurate and up-to-date.
- **KNN-Powered Search Function**: Utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, this feature enhances user experience by delivering relevant search results. This capability allows customers to efficiently find the jamu products they are looking for, ultimately improving user satisfaction and engagement.
- **Minimalist and User-Friendly Interface**: The website's interface is designed to be minimalist and user-friendly, ensuring that visitors can easily navigate and quickly locate the information they need. This design approach minimizes confusion and promotes user engagement, providing a pleasant shopping experience. Additionally, optimization for various devices ensures consistent and functional display on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **SEO Optimization Tools (Google Search Console, Bing Webmaster, and Google Analytics)**: By integrating these tools, the website can be monitored and optimized to enhance visibility on search engines. Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster enable site owners to analyze search performance and identify issues, while Google Analytics provides insights into visitor behavior, including traffic volume, session duration, and traffic sources. These elements are critical for improving SEO strategies and attracting more visitors to the site.

## Technologies Used

- **Codeigniter**: Used for rapid development of web applications with a clear structure and efficient routing capabilities.
- **Bootstrap**: Utilized for creating responsive, mobile-first designs with pre-built components that streamline the development process.
- **PhpMyAdmin**: Employed for managing and administering MySQL databases with an intuitive web interface.
- **Google Recaptcha**: Implemented to enhance security by preventing spam and automated abuse in web forms.
